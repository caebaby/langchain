**Agentic Business Transformation Vision & Context**\
Executive Summary\
I am building a fully autonomous AI agent infrastructure using
LangChain/LangGraph to run the majority of my coaching and consulting
business operations. This system will handle everything from marketing
and sales to fulfillment and operations, with deep business context and
memory across all departments. Additionally, I aim to help other
businesses implement similar agentic transformations, taking equity
positions in exchange for building their AI infrastructure.\
